# Hey! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aaron Keisler, a self-taught web developer, legal technology advocate and occasional mountain climber.

I like find technical solutions to problems and learn why things work the way they do. Constant user of 'inspect element' and the 'network' and 'debug' panels of a browser's Developer Tools.
